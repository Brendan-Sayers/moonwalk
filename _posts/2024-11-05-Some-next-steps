##### Some Next steps 

I have the transistor modulator mostly working;
Post outline idea
- Theory of operation 
- debugging behavior 
- compare with board

Some other things I want to do

- Plan out component buys / finilize bom 
 
 - Input filter, C1
 - Output bulk C4
 - Connector system -> Thinking Minifit jr or micofit, something I can get "universal" crimper to work with; Cheap is good too. 
 - Inductor
