##### Buck converter overview 


This is the first of some projects that I put in the unfinished business category.
In this case it was a buck converter, for a school project. 10V input, and 5V output at 10 Watts. I think efficiency in the 90% was the goal. 
It happened during covid, so it didn't get done.

Anyways, I plan to build, and learn and do a couple things along the way 

To start with, the idea was to design from scratch, which for something like this is a good idea, really if it's to learn. 

Somethings I want to on this project 

- Develop my design proccess 

Sketch -> SPICE -> PCB -> Assembly -> Testing 

Designing in software
making accurate enough simulations, that I can I can get started in maybe one draft 
- Transistor modulator 
- Full buck model 
- Modeling signal injection and control loop 


Learning the proccess of getting a circuit from a sketch to in my hands 
- Who to order from 
- Using stencils/ solder paste 
- Figuring out what the smallest thing I can solder actually is 

Setting up a home lab 
- putting all the stuff I have together 
- soldering without setting off smoke alarms 
- making it ergonomic 

Testing 
- Signal injection with a hantek scope
