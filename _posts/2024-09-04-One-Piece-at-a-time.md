#### The idea behnind the my projects

This for the forseeable future, is going to be about small, silly, and in many ways backwards. 
There's a couple reasons for this that are somewhat specific to me, and some other reasons why I think this is a good approach to learning and doing. 

1) Although I'm an electrical engineer by training, and have worked in industry for a couple years, all in roles that I feel are accurately described as electrical engineering,  and for a lot of it directly at an electronics company, it's been analyzing circuits, rareley design. It's always been finishing things someone else started.
Not to discount that time in anyway. I've learn a lot about troublehshooting, about industrial machinery, learned a lot about writing software (in fact that actually how I describe what I do; as an electrical engineer who writes software), a huge amount of practical experience in how PCBs are desgined, built and tested. Maybe the most useful thing has been learning how translate between techinical proccesses and business operations. 

(Learning about cashflow, and getting a sense of how it works for your company/industry, makes working life less frustrating.
Every day there's some kind problem or decision or deadline you don't like. Seeing it from the perspective of your boss, or the business, and maybe even agreeing with it, makes it less painful)


I've never been a good student, school didn't move at the pace I learn. I was also in the middle of covid when I started doing well, which then threw me off.
I really hate writing that; It sounds like I'm making an excuse. My intention, however, is to layout my unfinished business. In the time since school, I think I've caught up in a lot of ways. It's been in bits and pieces, in app note and articles, stack exchange  questions, book passages, and looking at circuits I've seen before and working on them until I understand. I think it's there now, and I guess this is to prove it.

Q: Why am I starting small 
A: Because that's where I have to begin 

Why is this a good approach? 

1) Knowledge compounds.

2) At the rate you iterate 

3) Keeping it fun prevents burnout 

In the past, projects I've tried might have been too ambitious, going straight to making something useful.
In contrast now I'm delib
